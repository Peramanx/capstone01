    <p>I am a family man in my thirties ready to tackle new challenges in the world of web development. My current daily job revolves around Azure, but my long time passion has been able to create stunning and user friendly web pages. I think we all know frustration when you go to a website and yell "This should've been done like this!" So I want to be on the other end and try to create a place without that.</p>
